Installed locally using homebrew `brew install rabbitmq`

Running node using: `brew services start rabbitmq` -->
`Successfully started `rabbitmq` (label: homebrew.mxcl.rabbitmq)`

Had no technical issues, worked through the editor which was fairly straight forwards. Just had a little difficulty with the dependency at the start
